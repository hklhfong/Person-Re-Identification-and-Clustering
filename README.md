Siamese Network for Image Classification
This section of the notebook demonstrates how to implement a Siamese network for image classification. The Siamese network is a type of neural network architecture designed for tasks such as face recognition and image similarity. The code includes the following key steps:

Loading and preprocessing image data from files.
Creating pairs of images and labels for training and testing.
Defining the Siamese network architecture using Keras.
Implementing a custom triplet loss function.
Training the Siamese network on the provided image pairs.
Visualizing anchor, positive, and negative image pairs.
Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models
In this section, you explore clustering techniques using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). GMMs are probabilistic models that can capture complex data distributions. The code includes the following steps:

Loading and preparing data, including parsing movie genres.
Plotting the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Fitting GMMs with the optimal number of clusters.
Visualizing the results, including bar plots of cluster sizes and movie genres for the top clusters.
Multi-Label Classification with Deep Learning
This section demonstrates how to build a deep learning model for multi-label classification. The code includes the following tasks:

Loading and preprocessing image data for multi-label classification.
Defining a deep learning model architecture using the Xception base model.
Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Compiling the model with multiple loss functions and metrics for each label.
Training the model on the training data with early stopping.
Evaluating the model on the validation and test sets.
Each section of the notebook is self-contained and provides detailed explanations of the code and its purpose. You can follow the code sequentially to understand and replicate the experiments for these different tasks. Additionally, you may need to install the required Python libraries and packages, such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and OpenCV, to run the code successfully.
